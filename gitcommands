Create a yml file and add the below code to setup automated testing and deployment for the project

name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
push:
branches: - main
pull_request:
branches: - main

jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Deploy (if applicable)
        run: |
          echo "Deploying application..."
